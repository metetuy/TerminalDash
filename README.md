# Terminal Dash- A Terminal Game

This project was originally developed as an assignment for the **Data Structures** class. Since then, it has been upgraded to be fully playable in the Windows terminal.

## How to Run
To play the game, navigate to the project folder in **PowerShell** and run the following command:
```
make run
```

## Customization
- **Game Speed:** You can adjust the speed of the game by modifying the `Sleep(150);` function in `GameController.cpp`.
- **Level Design:** Several pre-designed levels are available in the `sample_io` folder. You can also create your own custom levels to enhance your experience.

## Future Updates
A **level creator** may be added in the future, allowing the game to continue indefinitely with dynamically generated levels.

Enjoy the game and feel free to contribute or customize it to your liking!
